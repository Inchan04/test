  You get lost on your way back home, just about anywhere
  You sing off key to the radio, like nobody's there
  And I love that your Sunday's best is a holey pair of jeans
  And I don't stand a chance when you smile
  Yeah the longer that we're together
  The good keeps on getting better
  I never thought that I would ever find someone like you
  Every day you show me I can,
  Just when I think that I can't love you anymore than I do, I do
  You change your hair colour every week, 'cause you're never quite sure of it
  And I know when you're mad at me, 'cause you tell me what I did
  And all I think is beautiful, when I think of you
  And I still can't believe that you're mine
  Yeah the longer that we're together
  The good keeps on getting better
  I never thought that I would ever find someone like you
  Every day you show me I can
  Just when I think that I can't love you anymore than I do
  I do, I do
  All I see is beautiful, when I look at you
  Yeah the longer that we're together
  The good keeps on getting better
